You like ranks overhead for staff and vip you can have custom icons set besides the rank or remove the icon set rainbow text or any color you want. Also text correction because I hate seeing "user" so we can make it "User" without having to remake the ulx rank. We can even give players custom ulx ranks and set the name to whatever you want.
MagicHud.EnableRankDisplay = true OR false
MagicHud.RankSettings = {
    user = {
        DisplayName = "User",
        Color = Color(255, 255, 255),
        Icon = "icon16/user.png", -- REMOVE THIS LINE TO REMOVE THE ICON.
		RainbowColor = true OR false
    },

Armor is built into the hud when you dont have armor it does not show up for simplicity.
